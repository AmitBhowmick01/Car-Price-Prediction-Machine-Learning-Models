# **Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning Models**

This project focuses on predicting car prices using machine learning models, specifically Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boosting Regressor. The models are trained on a dataset containing relevant car features such as make, model, year, mileage, and more.

## Features

- Utilizes Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boosting Regressor algorithms for accurate price predictions.
- Preprocessing techniques applied to handle missing values, feature scaling, and categorical variable encoding.
- Evaluates model performance using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared (R2).


## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation contains a comprehensive collection of car features and corresponding prices. It is provided in a CSV format and can be found in the data directory.

## Results

The trained models provide accurate predictions of car prices based on the given dataset. Model evaluation metrics such as MSE and R2 are included to assess performance. Feature importance analysis reveals the significant factors affecting car prices.
